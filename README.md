This is the inofficial way to access eurostat statistical data as a raster data cube.

# Motivation

Time series anlysis is challenging, because NUTS codes, names and geographical boundaries may change over time.
This project provides a unified interface to eurostat data as rasters, e.g. to be used together with sattelite imagery or climate model outputs.
